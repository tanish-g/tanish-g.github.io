I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, working on LLM alignment, preference optimization, and efficient AI architectures. My work revolves around enhancing large language models (LLMs) through multi-preference optimization, reward modeling, and structured efficiency improvements. 
Prior to my current role, I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering & Engineering Physics from IIT (ISM) Dhanbad. During my studies, I interned at Microsoft Research, CMU AirLab, Sprinklr, Sony Research India, and ShareChat, where I gained hands-on experience in inference optimization, multimodal learning, and AI-driven applications, contributing to research and engineering projects across these domains.
